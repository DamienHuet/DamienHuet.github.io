- title: "Graduate Researcher, Computational Physicist"
  institution: "The University of British Columbia"
  description: "Created a high-performance, parallel computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code for
multiphase flows performing orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art.
Received public congratulations for my contribution and my rigorous code documentation
and code testing practices from the owner of the widely used open-source Basilisk software.
Dramatically improved a high-performance, parallel simulation solver for granular materials
by implementing a model decreasing the solver inaccuracies by up to 6 orders of magnitude.
Led research collaborations involving physical modeling, computing on parallel machines, confirming fidelity of the solver and models using experimental data, and submitting our findings to top-tier peer-reviewed journals.
Demonstrated willingness to learn new methods under minimal supervision.
Self-motivated: created my own ambitious goals and met them in a fast-paced environment."
