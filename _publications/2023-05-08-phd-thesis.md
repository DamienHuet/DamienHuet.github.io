excerpt: 'Computer simulations are an indispensable tool to understand and predict the behavior of many complex natural and industrial processes. In particular, complex flows such as rockfalls or flowing blood through microcirculation rely heavily on numerical tools as they are described by equations mathematicians cannot solve by hand. In this thesis, we develop improved numerical methods in order to simulate such complex flows. We first focus on granular flows composed of entangled particles. We study their complex intrication behavior as a step forward in the modeling of complex granular media, which are very common in industrial processes. Then we develop an efficient method to simulate highly deformable biological cells such as red blood cells. This method allows us to study the behavior of deformable cells in large and complex geometries, and therefore constitutes a valuable tool for biologists developing lab-on-chip devices used for instance to provide cheap and fast diagnoses.'
