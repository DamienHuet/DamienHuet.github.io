excerpt: 'The smooth Distinct Element Method (DEM) is a numerical simulation technique used in the study of granular materials. The applications are numerous in the industry and in academia, especially in the life sciences field. Smooth DEM implies specifying inter-particles contact forces that are involved during the explicit numerical integration of the Newtonâ€™s laws of motion. In this thesis, we implement a tangential contact force accounting for a memory effect and leading to static behaviors that are known to show improved accordance with experiments. However, the validation procedure was tainted by what is believed to be the effect of an inaccurate rolling friction model.
Simultaneoulsy, a multi-step higher order scheme was implemented, allowing the use of larger time steps at almost no additional computation cost. Validation of this scheme was successful in some ideal cases, while the effect on error scaling of time discretization itself is extensively discussed.'
