excerpt: 'In this paper, we explore the behavior of granular avalanches of nonconvex cross-shaped particles as a step forward in the modeling of entangled granular media. We conduct experiments and simulations of a dam break setup and report several flow regimes such as the top-driven collapse and the intermittent regime, in which the granular column sometimes remains stable and the flow outcome is determined by the random initial microstructure.'
